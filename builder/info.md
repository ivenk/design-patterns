## Builder design pattern

The builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. The otherwise difficult act is broken into multiple small steps allowing for an easier creation process.
The builder must be able to build different versions of the same class. 
The class including the creation process gets simplified.

### Compare
The builder pattern can be compared with the abstract factory pattern as both can be used to create complex objects.
